"""Runnable end-to-end demo for `cost_model_agent.py`.

Run it two ways:

    # Offline: a scripted "LLM" drives the whole loop (no API key, no network).
    # Use this to confirm the harness + sandbox work on your machine.
    python3 demo.py --offline

    # Real: drive with an OpenRouter model.
    export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
    python3 demo.py --model openai/gpt-5

Requirements: `local_python_executor.py` next to this file. For --offline you
need nothing else. For the real path: `pip install openai`.

The plans here are tiny DUCK-TYPED stand-ins for palimpzest `PhysicalPlan`s, so
the demo runs without a full palimpzest dataset. The agent code never imports
them — it only relies on iterating operators + reading attributes — so swapping
in real `PhysicalPlan`s (from palimpzest's optimizer) requires no agent changes:
just put real plans in the `plans` dict.
